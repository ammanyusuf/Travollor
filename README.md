# Travollor

Travollor is a Travel Management System that deals with tourists finding the best deals and places to visit by getting recommendations from trusty locals. Our project's functionalities include interacting with a database by setting up API endpoints to interact with our data. These API endpoints represent how different users in our system can interact with the data to retrieve specific information. 

## Tools we used
* Database Management System: MySQL
* Framework to process web requests: ASP .NET 
* Application used to test our API endpoints: Postman

3. Hit the run button
