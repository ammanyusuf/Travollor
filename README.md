# Travollor

Travollor is a Travel Management System that deals with tourists finding the best deals and places to visit by getting recommendations from trusty locals. Our project's functionalities include interacting with a database by setting up API endpoints to interact with our data. These API endpoints represent how different users in our system can interact with the data to retrieve specific information. 

## Tools we used
